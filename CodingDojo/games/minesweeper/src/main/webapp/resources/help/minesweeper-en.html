                            <p>A challenge for the mind and a bit of fun - it's about the updated version of the
                                minesweeper game by the Lviv JS Community!
                                We’re launching a coding game where instead of seeking bombs, you need to look for
                                infected cells and send them to "quarantine." Write your rescue bot and fight with other
                                virus fighters!

                            </p>
                            <h2>Who can participate?</h2>
                            <p>EPAMers who are familiar with JavaScript, Java, C #, or Python and strive not only to
                                have fun but also to improve approaches to algorithmic programming.

                            </p>

                            <h2>How to play?
                            </h2>
                            <p>Each player has his playing field and can move around in free cells in all four
                                directions. The only way to know whether there are viruses around the cell is to get
                                into it. The revealed number shows the number of infected cells around the current one.
                                If there is no number, then everything is OK. If the player comes across an infected
                                cell, the game is over. Therefore, you should consider in advance how to "clear" the
                                area in a given direction.


                            </p>
                            <p>To start, you need to <a
                                    href="http://static.cdn.epam.com/uploads/02667d107833051af35dd4d782fd99fb/minesweeper-servers.zip">
                                    download the client of your programming language</a>
                                and run it.

                            </p>
                            <h2>How to win?</h2>
                            <p>For correctly moved quarantine cells the player receives bonus points, for an error -
                                penalty points. After a mistake, the player appears on a new field with random placement
                                of infected cells and plays first (because you need to save the planet!) - and so an
                                infinite number of times. After adding all points, the player with the highest total
                                points wins (as of a certain point in time).

                            </p>
                            <h2>Well, are you ready to fight viruses? :)</h2>

                                    download the client</a>, select your programming language, and connect to the server
                                via the web socket.

                                A 'user' is the id of the player, a 'code' is your security token, which you get from
                                the address bar in the browser after registration/login.

                            </p>

                            <p>After connecting, the client will regularly (every second) receive a string of characters
                                - with the encoded state of the field. The format is:
                            </p>

                            <pre>^board=(.*)$</pre>
                            <p>With this regexp, you can draw a bord line. Here is an example line from the server:

                            </p>

                            <p>The length of the string is equal to the area of the field. If you insert a line break
                                character every sqrt (length (string)) characters, you get a readable image of the
                                field.

                                updated field at the moment and awaits a response - a command to the player. In the next
                                second, the player must timely give the player a command. If you don’t do that on time,
                                the player stands still.
